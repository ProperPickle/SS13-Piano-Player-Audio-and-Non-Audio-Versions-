# SS13 Piano Player (Audio & Non-Audio versions)
## These are programs for playing songs using a virtual piano.
### Description
There are two versions of this code, the non-audio version takes the code of a song and simulates keypresses to play this song on a virtual piano, such as those found in video games. The audio version takes this same song and simulates what it would sound like if played on a virtual piano.
A Java alternative to the numerous MIDI players, no outside software is required for this project, and it aims to be simple and quick to install and use.
### Hopeful future fixes
- [ ] Integrate the F5 program pause, instead of the current F5 program terminate.
- [x] Combine the two applications into one that allows you to toggle between the two.
- [ ] Add the ability to toggle between milliseconds per note for tempo and the more common beats per minute.
- [ ] Spruce up the program's GUI, making it more visually inviting.
