Code for new songs can be found from "https://pianoletternotes.blogspot.com/"
	Go to a song you'd like to play.
	Copy the songs code in its entirety, starting from just below the audio player area until the image or Amazon Audio Player ad at the bottom (All the colorful, copyable text).
	Paste it in the "Enter Song Code Here" text box in the "Add a Preset" or "Play a New Song" menus.
Instructions:
	Playing a Preset song:
		- Press "Preset Songs" button.
		- Choose the preset song you'd like to play in the dropdown box.
		- Press "Play Selected Preset (Audio)" button to audibly play the selected preset song or the "Play Selected Preset (Non-Audio)" button to play the song using simulated keystrokes (via virtual instrument).
		
	Playing a new, non-preset song:
		- Press "Play a New Song" button.
		- Enter the song code, as described above.
		- Enter an integer song tempo value in the "Enter Song Tempo Here" textbox just below. This is the number of milliseconds between notes, and is typically around 100. Use trial and error to find the perfect tempo for your song.
		- Press "Play Composed Song (Audio)" button to audibly play the composed song or the "Play Composed Song (Non-Audio)" to play the song using simulated keystroked (via virtual instrument).
	Adding a new Preset song:
		- Press "Add a Preset" button.
		- Enter the name of the song you'd like to add, you don't have to add a file extension, as ".son" will be appended.
		- Enter the song code, as described above.
		- Enter an integer song tempo value in the "Enter Song Tempo Here" textbox just below. This is the number of milliseconds between notes, and is typically around 100. Use trial and error to find the perfect tempo for your song.
		- Press "Save New Preset" button to save the preset! You may have to close and reopen the application to have the song appear in the dropdown box of the Preset Songs menu, but you should be able to now play your new songs from the Preset Songs menu using the above mentioned method!
		
Tips:
	- When composing a song, playing it audbily is useful for testing tempo values on new songs, as it will make it immediately apparent whether or not the inputted tempo value is correct for the song.
	- Pressing "F5" should immediately kill the program, however, if the f5 input is being eaten by the in-focus application, it's possible the program wont detect it and terminate. X-ing out of the program will always close it and stop the current song.
	- If you find any bugs in the code, or have tips on how to clean it up, please don't hesitate to contact me/contribute on GitHub.
