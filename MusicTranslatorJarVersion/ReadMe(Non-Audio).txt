Code for new songs can be found from "https://pianoletternotes.blogspot.com/"
	Go to a song you'd like to play.
	Copy the songs code in its entirety, starting from just below the audio player area until the image or Amazon Audio Player ad at the bottom (All the colorful, copyable text).
	Paste it in the "Enter Song Code Here" text box in the "Add a Preset" or "Play a New Song" menus.
Instructions:
	Playing a Preset song:
		- Press "Preset Songs" button.
		- Choose the preset song you'd like to play in the dropdown box.
		- Press "Play Selected Preset" button to play the selected preset song, this non-audio version of the code will attempt to play the song using simulated keystrokes, so be sure you have a virtual piano open!
		
	Playing a new, non-preset song:
		- Press "Play a New Song" button.
		- Enter the song code, as described above.
		- Enter an integer song tempo value in the "Enter Song Tempo Here" textbox just below. This is the number of milliseconds between notes, and is typically around 100. Use trial and error to find the perfect tempo for your song.
		- Press "Play Composed Song" button to play the composed song, this non-audio version of the code will attempt to play the song using simulated keystrokes, so be sure you have a virtual piano open!
	
	Adding a new Preset song:
		- Press "Add a Preset" button.
		- Enter the name of the song you'd like to add, you don't have to add a file extension, as ".son" will be appended.
		- Enter the song code, as described above.
		- Enter an integer song tempo value in the "Enter Song Tempo Here" textbox just below. This is the number of milliseconds between notes, and is typically around 100. Use trial and error to find the perfect tempo for your song.
		- Press "Save New Preset" button to save the preset! You may have to close and reopen the application to have the song appear in the dropdown box of the Preset Songs menu, but you should be able to now play your new songs from the Preset Songs menu using the above mentioned method!
		
Tips:
	- When trying to find the correct tempo value for a new song, it may be easier to use the audio version of this code, as it will actually play the song instead of simulating key presses, and will make it immediately obvious if you've entered the correct tempo value.
	- Pressing "F5" should immediately kill the program, mostly used if the simulated keypresses are sending inputs to the wrong application, which normally happens if focus on the correct application is lost.
	- If you find any bugs in the code, or have tips on how to clean it up, please don't hesitate to contact me on GitHub.
